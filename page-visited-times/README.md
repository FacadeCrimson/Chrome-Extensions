Page Visits Counter
-------------------

### Function

For common job search websites, this extension will record how many times you have visited a certain page and the most recent time you visited it.

I make this extension since job search websites can't record if you have already seen a certain job posting, thus, user may waste time reading the same job posting again if they do multiple searches using different search terms.


### Options

*   Click clear button on certain page to delete that page's past record.
*   In extension options page, customrize the background color of the extension popup.
*   In extension options page, clear all past records.


### Thanks
