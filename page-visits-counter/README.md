Page Visits Counter
-------------------

### Function

1. For all websites, this extension will record how many times you have visited a certain page and the most recent time you visited it. This info is displayed in this extension's popup.

2. In this extension's option page, you can add and delete arbitrary numbers of keywords. Then whenever you visit a new website, the popup will remind you if any keyword exists in the text of the page. You also have the option to turn on/off highlighting, which will highlight all keyword occurences with yello background and larger font. 

3. You could clear the history of a single page by clicking popup button. If you want to clear all visits counters, you could do so in the option page.

### Usage

The number on the icon indicates how many times you have visited this page. The popup will also show when you last visited this page and if it contains certain keywords.
The webpage will highlight keywords you set if you turn on the option.

I make this extension since when you visit job search websites, there are some requirements that you may pay special attention to such as years of experience, visa sponsorship, etc.. but those information will be very hard to spot in long paragraphs of texts, and tiring to do so if you view those pages in hundreds. User may also waste time reading the same job posting again if they do multiple searches using different search terms. Thus, this extension is born.

However, the functions of the extension is beyond the above usages and could be applied to any circumstances where you need to keep a track of the pages that you have visited or to highlight certain contents that you care about in the text. Feel free to download it and load into Chrome and give it a try.
