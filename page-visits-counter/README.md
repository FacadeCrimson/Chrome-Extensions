Page Visits Counter
-------------------

### Function

For all websites, this extension will record how many times you have visited a certain page and the most recent time you visited it. It will also remind you if a certain keyword exists in the text of the page.

I make this extension since job search websites can't record if you have already seen a certain job posting, thus, user may waste time reading the same job posting again if they do multiple searches using different search terms.

### Usage

The number on the icon indicates how many times you have visited this page. The popup will also show when you last visited this page and if it contains certain keywords.


### Options

*   Click clear button in popup to delete current page's past record.
*   In extension options page, customise the background color of the extension popup.
*   In extension options page, clear all past records.
